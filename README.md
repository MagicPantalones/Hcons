> ## How to build repo in Android Studio

- Download repo and extract to preferred folder

- _**Do not import the project to Android Studio yet. You will not be able to build the project.**_

- Go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), register a new account and add a new project.

- Press the cog-wheel, select `Project Settings`, press the Android logo and follow steps 1. and 2.

- Go to Firebase Authentication and set up Email as the _**only**_ sign-in method.
 - You need to create user accounts manually for now. I have not implemented sign-up yet.
  I want to avoid unauthorized users until I write more secure rules, and test the database data scaling.

- Open Android studio, go to `File > New > Import Project`, select the folder you extracted and
wait for the magic to happen. If it prompts you to update any project dependencies or implementations, decline.
